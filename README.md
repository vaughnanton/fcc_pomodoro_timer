The Pomodoro Technique is a time management system that uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. This app employs the Pomodoro method with customizable work and break lengths, including an alarm at the end of each sequence! I also spiced the visuals up a bit with a “flip clock” feature via the API listed below.
